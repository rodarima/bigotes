.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is a versatile tool designed to perform automatic benchmark
measurements and report statistical information. A single quantity is
sampled multiple times by either running again a given program or by
reading the values from the standard input. The typical quantity 
is the execution time, but others can be used too.
.Pp
The execution of the program is repeated until at least 30 samples are
collected and 30 seconds have elapsed. Both criteria must be met to stop
collecting samples.
.Pp
At the end, a summary is presented with several statistics. An histogram
is also plotted by using UTF-8 block characters and the results of the
Shapiro-Wilk test for normality:
.Bd -literal -offset xx
% bigotes -w -s 'sleep 0.1'

.Ed
The list of summary values is described as as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em MIN
The minimum value of the sample.
.It Em Q1
The first quartile (25 percentile) of the sample.
.It Em MEDIAN
The median of the sample.
.It Em MEAN
The mean of the sample.
.It Em Q3
The third quartile (75 percentile) of the sample.
.It Em MAX
The maximum value of the sample.
.It Em N
The number of samples.
.It Em WALL
The total amount of wall clock time the program spent running.
.It Em FAR
The number of outlier values that are "far out" as defined by John
Tukey with k=3. That is, values smaller than Q1-3*(Q3-Q1) or bigger
than Q3+3*(Q3-Q1).
.It Em MAD
The median absolute deviation of the sample, scaled by 1.4826 to match
the value of the standard deviation in a normal distribution.
.It Em STDEV
The standard deviation of the sample.
.It Em SKEW
The sample skewness, a measure of the asymmetry of the probability
distribution about its mean.
.It Em KURTOSIS
The sample excess kurtosis (kurtosis minus 3). A value larger than 0
indicates a fatter tail in the probability distribution when compared to
a normal distribution, and often occurs in outliers.
.El
.Pp
.Pp
There are three modes of operation and one must be selected.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -
Selects the
.Em exec
mode (the default). Runs the command and arguments as-is, without a shell. The 
.Fl -
flag may be omitted.
.It Fl s
Selects the
.Em shell
mode. Runs the
.Ar script
in a shell, performing the shell substitution as
necessary. Allows processing the output with a pipe, but requires
escaping quotes.
.It Fl i
Selects the
.Em stdin
mode. Reads quantities values from the standard input, one per line.
Nothing is executed in this mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar options
must precede the operation mode and are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar file
Write the measured quantities in the given
.Ar file ,
one per line. Not compatible with the stdin mode.
.It Fl q
Be quiet, don't report progress information during execution.
.It Fl w
Instead of reading the quantity from the standard output, use the
wall clock time (in seconds) that the program took to run. Not
compatible with the stdin mode.
.It Fl X
Remove outliers from the stopping criteria and histogram. The summary
statistics always use all samples.
.El
.Pp
The name
.Nm
comes from the Spanish word for whiskers which are commonly used in
statistics to represent the dispersion of a sample when drawing box
plots or error bars.
